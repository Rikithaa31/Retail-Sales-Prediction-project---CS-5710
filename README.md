# Retail Sales Prediction

## Introduction
This project focuses on predicting the total sales amount for a customer transaction using retail shopping data. The workflow includes data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory analysis, and building machine learning models.  
We trained and compared **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** regressors to identify the model with the best predictive performance.  
The final solution includes a **Streamlit web application** where users can input transaction details and get an instant predicted sales value.
